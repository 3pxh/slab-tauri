# SLAB!

## Dev
- `npm run tauri dev` to run the app
- `python iconGenerator.py` will take the icon in public/ and regen app icons

## Stages

1. Just show RPG world. Then slide boss row from below. Boss says Slab! The slab panel slides in from the right. You build slabs. When you finish a slab, the slab panel slides away.
2. Boss tells you that you're a boss now. (How? Does the boss create the new UI by speaking? bppbBbpbpbb -- how could you see the boss panel while all of those slide in?) The worker dialogue appears (slides in from the left) in the bottom left, and the slab-goal slides in to its right. (boss dialogue now bottom right) -- when the boss makes a new slab in the target area it gets built out iteratively with the animations!!
